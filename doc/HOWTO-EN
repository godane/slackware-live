To create a live Slackware system, two Slackware systems are needed:
- the first one, with Slackware-Live, Unionfs-FUSE and SquashFS-Tools 
will be used to build the live system;
- the second one is the system to make live.

Remarq: it is possible to have a single system (that transforms itself 
into a live system). Be carreful: all directories but `/sys', `/proc',
`/dev' and `/tmp' are included in the live system; think to umount 
removable devices for example.

To get detailed usage and example of how to build a live system, 
run `build-slackware-live.sh' without parameters.
