===== Live system files organisation during execution =====
- The directory `/live/media' is the live media mount point (CD/DVD/USB);
- the directory `/live/modules' contains the SquashFS modules mount points;
- the directory `/live/system' is the union of the modules mount points (read-only);
- the directory `/live/union' is the union of the directory `/live/changes' (write) and of the modules mount points;
- the directory `/live/changes' contains the modifications done to the live system (copy on write);
- the directories at root are mount points binded to the directories of `/live/union'.

To add a SquashFS module while the live system is running, mount it in a subdirectory 
of `/live/modules', then add it to the union `/live/union'; example:
`mkdir /live/modules/module_name'
`mount -o loop -t squashfs module_name /live/modules/module_name'
`mount -o remount,add:1:/live/modules/module_name=ro /live/union'


===== Conversion of a SquashFS module into a directory =====
- Mount the module: `mount -o loop -t squashfs the_module mount_point';
- copy files into an other directory: `cp -dpr mount_point destination_directory';
- umount the module: `umount mount_point'.
